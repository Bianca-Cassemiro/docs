As a blockchain-powered network, Helium relies on on-chain [accounts](https://docs.solana.com/developing/programming-model/accounts) to safeguard Hotspots and Tokens. An account serves as an abstraction for a cryptographic key, comprising two components: a public key and a private key. This dual-key system is rooted in public key cryptography, a widely adopted cryptographic framework. While users familiar with conventional web environments may be accustomed to usernames and passwords for authentication, web3 projects like Helium substitute these traditional credentials with private and public keys.

## Diving into Crypto Wallets

A cryptocurrency wallet serves as a custodian for both public and private cryptographic keys, facilitating the transmission, receipt, and management of cryptocurrency assets. These wallets come in various forms, including digital directories on computers, physical paper codes, or specialized hardware devices. Additionally, a plethora of apps and software solutions offer streamlined processes for creating and maintaining wallets.

The Helium Foundation oversees the development and maintenance of the [Helium Wallet App](/wallets/helium-wallet-app), tailored specifically to meet the requirements of the Helium Network. However, given that Helium is a Solana-native token, it can also be accessed through any Solana-compatible wallet.

## Understanding Public and Private Keys

As the names imply, there is a distinction between the different keys that are generated when
creating a new Helium account, or any other web3 account for that matter. The distinction between
these keys is important to understand.

### Public Key

The public key is your 'calling card' on the blockchain. Anyone with it can view token balances,
Hotspots, and any associated history of these entities. The public key is the address that can be
shared.

For purposes of security, the public key cannot be used to determine the private key.

For Helium and other projects on Solana, public keys are strings of letters and numbers that look
like `dcuc8Amr83Wz27ZkQ2K9NS6r8zRpf1J6cvArEBDZDmm`. Strings beginning with `11`, `13`, or `14` are
likely to be keys on the old Helium blockchain. Double-check these addresses using the
[conversion tool on this page](#legacy-l1-conversion).

### Private Key

Your account's private key is sacrosanct and must never be shared, safeguarded against potential theft at all costs. Losing a private key is irreversible, with no recourse for recovery. In the event of misplacing or forgetting the _public_ key, however, the private key can be utilized to determine it, leveraging the derivation path implemented by the Helium Wallet App accounts.

Private keys manifest in various forms, with the most familiar being the [12-word or 24-word seed phrases](/wallets/wallet-seed-phrase). Additionally, certain tools facilitate the management of private key phrases, stored either in a file format such as `keyfile.bin`, or as an extended string of alphanumeric characters.

Private keys grant unfettered access to an account's entirety and thus warrant stringent protection. It's important to note that these keys are never required for diagnosing a Hotspot or for on-chain transaction purposes.

:::warning Important summary: Never give away your seed phrases or private keys

Avoid entering or sending private keys to any untrusted websites or applications.  
Helium support does not require these details for any reason, including support, airdrop, or
redemption.

## Wallet Migration

If you have not accessed your wallet since the blockchain migration to Solana on April 18, 2023,
refer to the [Wallet migration guide](/solana/migration/wallet-user).

To learn about moving your account from the Helium Wallet App to another Solana-compatible wallet,
see the guide in [Third-Party Wallets](/wallets/third-party-wallets).

### Legacy Helium Addresses {#legacy-l1-conversion}

This tool displays the equivalent public addresses between the legacy Helium blockchain and the
current Solana accounts. Legacy account addresses should not be used when sending transactions
between accounts or from exchanges.
