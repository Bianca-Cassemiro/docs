## Charter

- Quick Guide
  - The Manufacturing Compliance Committee ("MCC") was formed to set basic standards and verify
    compliance of the Hotspots being added to the Helium Network through
    [HIP-19: Approval Process For Third-Party Manufacturers](https://github.com/helium/HIP/blob/master/0019-third-party-manufacturers.md).
  - The MCC reviews and votes to approve HIP-19 proposals.
  - The purpose of the MCC is to ensure the security and integrity of the blockchain.
  - The MCC does not endorse, govern, or regulate third-party manufacturers.
  - The MCC requires manufacturers to submit copies of their regulatory compliance reports as part
    of the final audit.
  - The MCC has the power to grant and revoke maker keys.

## Purpose and Goals

The Manufacturing Compliance Committee (MCC) was formed to sets basic standards and verify that
these technical, security, and ethical standards are met by manufacturers joining the Helium Network
through the **[HIP-19](https://github.com/helium/HIP/blob/main/0019-third-party-manufacturers.md)**
process.

Venturing into the realm of Hotspot manufacturing poses a novel challenge for most manufacturers. Many are unfamiliar with decentralized systems and the blockchain, along with their intricate nuances of trustlessness and associated responsibilities. While these features offer immense potential benefits, they also introduce a risk: the possibility that unsuspecting or unscrupulous manufacturers may produce and distribute products that could potentially compromise the integrity of the network.

To address this concern, the MCC (Manufacturing Certification Committee) is tasked with a crucial mandate: to ensure that manufacturers and their products adhere to the minimum functional requirements essential for participation within the Network. This entails rigorous scrutiny of blockchain-related transactions, verification of compliance with relevant regulatory standards for all radio hardware, and confirmation that devices meet essential authentication, encryption, and security benchmarks necessary to safeguard the network. It's important to note that while the MCC diligently evaluates these technical aspects, it does not assess or enforce general product quality standards, oversee the overall product quality or manufacturing process, or conduct tests to optimize RF performance. Instead, the MCC focuses solely on verifying basic RF functionality to ensure compatibility with Network requirements.

## Summary

The MCC endeavors to equip manufacturers for success by outlining the minimum standards they must meet and conducting a preliminary, non-binding assessment of pre-production units.

The MCC's review process unfolds at key junctures:

- Upon the submission of a new manufacturer's initial application, where company information undergoes scrutiny by both the Helium Foundation and the MCC.
- With the introduction of each new Helium-compatible product to the market, the MCC conducts a thorough evaluation.

This evaluation encompasses:

- Verification of proper completion of radio certifications required by respective countries.
- Conducting hardware audits to ensure compatibility with blockchain interfacing.

The MCC's authority is wielded through the issuance or revocation of "maker keys," which serve as passcodes enabling units to be added to the blockchain. This mechanism is intentionally blunt and decentralized to prevent any single entity from exerting undue control over the ecosystem. If a maker were to selectively withhold the ability of certain hotspots or groups of hotspots to participate in earning blockchain rewards, it would amass disproportionate and centralized power.

It's important to note that manufacturers are not bound or controlled by the MCC beyond the initial approval of their manufacturer application and subsequent submissions of Helium-compatible products for hardware audit and approval.

Post-approval, a manufacturer may fail to uphold the technical, security, and/or ethical standards set by the MCC. In such instances, the MCC retains the authority to reassess the conformity of all approved manufacturers and their Helium products at any time. If significant violations are identified, the MCC may recommend corrective actions and/or, at its discretion, opt to suspend or permanently revoke the manufacturer's "maker key(s)," thereby preventing the deployment of new Hotspots on the Helium network.

Given the decentralized nature of the ecosystem, the broader evaluation of which manufacturers deliver high-quality and/or high-performance products falls to the Helium Community and natural market forces. This places the onus of "buyer beware" primarily on purchasers, unlike many other centrally operated network-connected products, which are directly supported by the network operator.

### **MCC Member Requirements:**

The Manufacturing Compliance Committee will prioritize prospective members with backgrounds and
expertise in the following topics: blockchain, embedded systems, electronics manufacturing,
security, and electrical, RF, or computer engineering.

Committee members should demonstrate clear written communication and technical documentation skills.
They should have the ability to explain and educate others and conduct themselves diplomatically and
respectfully to the community.

Committee members should be active within the Helium community, and demonstrate alignment to grow
the Helium Network responsibly with reputable partners.

Committee members are expected to actively engage in MCC monthly meetings, discussions, and voting.
The Committee may vote to remove a member that misses more than two meetings per quarter.

MCC members may serve indefinitely unless they are removed or resign. However, it is recommended
that members cycle yearly.

- **Elections**
  - How to get nominated: MCC members may be nominated by a MCC member or a Helium Foundation
    member, then a vote will be held. ⅔ majority vote by the sitting committee must be met to
    approve the new member.
  - Removing a sitting committee member: The MCC may vote to remove a sitting committee member if
    they do not meet the expectations and requirements outlined in this document. A ⅔ majority vote
    will also remove a committee member.
  - Qualifications (see disciplines)
- **Voting**
  - Manufacturer approvals require a ⅔ majority vote.
  - Changes to the MCC charter require a ⅔ majority vote.
- **Reporting**
  - The MCC will meet for a live video call once a month. These monthly meetings are recorded and
    notes are taken, both are publicly available to the community.
    - Meeting are scheduled for 12pm ET on the 3rd Wednesday of each month. (This is subject to
      change due to holidays, emergencies, etc)
      - **Tentative 2023 Schedule:** _May 17, June 21, July 19, August 16, September 20, October 18,
        November 15, & December 20_

### **MCC Committee Composition:**

To provide optimal guidance, the MCC seeks diversification of participants from the Helium
community, Helium ecosystem participants, and domain experts.
