# Summary

This ethics document, authored by the Manufacturing Compliance Committee (MCC), serves as a comprehensive guide outlining the ethical expectations placed upon manufacturers within the Helium ecosystem. Should a manufacturer fail to adhere to the ethical standards delineated in this document, the Helium community retains the authority to initiate appropriate action against the manufacturer. Such actions may vary and could include requests for additional information, imposition of selling restrictions, temporary probationary measures, or in severe cases, the revocation of a maker's key or expulsion from the community.

The collective pursuit of establishing a globally decentralized Helium network necessitates the manufacturing of large volumes of Hotspots by a diverse array of manufacturers. To streamline this process and ensure adherence to rigorous standards, the existing HIP-19 application process and guidelines furnish both new and existing Helium Hotspot manufacturers with specific directives pertaining to hardware design, configuration, security protocols, and manufacturing requisites essential for attaining approval as a Helium-compatible Hotspot manufacturer.

Only manufacturers approved under the HIP-19 framework are entrusted with the esteemed privilege of adding new Hotspots to the Helium network. This privilege inherently entails a profound responsibility to conduct business ethically and uphold stringent internal processes aimed at safeguarding the integrity and stability of the Helium network.

## Ethics Tenents

### 1. Reporting Gaming

Manufacturers bear the responsibility to proactively report any potential “gamed” deployment by
their customers, partners, insiders, or employees.

- Gaming is defined as any product, process, or service that mines or earns HNT token rewards from
  the Helium blockchain without providing unimpeded Helium network coverage and/or data packet
  routing and throughput. For example, methods to spoof RSSI levels or attenuate RF signal
  propagation with the objective of faking network coverage are considered gaming.
  - Manufacturers will be held accountable for gaming infractions associated with the company’s
    employees, partners, or insiders.
  - Manufacturers shall not modify device firmware in any way to enable or facilitate “gaming”.
  - Manufacturers shall not provide services or access to proprietary technical reference material
    that facilitates gaming by their customers, partners, insiders, or employees.

### 2. Maintain Internal Controls of Swarm Keys

Manufacturers must have and maintain internal controls and processes to ensure the integrity of the
generation and registration of the miner swarm keys consistent with their HIP-19 approved
applications for the full life cycle of their products.

- These internal controls and processes may be subject to additional auditing if manufacturer
  activity warrants it.

### 3. Publish Order Fulfillment Process

Manufacturers must clearly publish **on their website** their order fulfillment process, including
the priority in which orders will be fulfilled, for both direct orders and by their authorized
distributor channels.

- Manufacturers must disclose **on their website** the monthly number of units being allocated to
  employees, company insiders, and/or partners for their first 12 months of initial production.

### 4. Publish Monthly Shipping Updates

Manufacturers must publish **on their website** monthly shipment updates for all back-ordered
products.

- The full terms and conditions of product sales, including the manufacturer's refund policy, must
  be clearly published on the company and/or authorized distributor websites.
  - Refund policy must explicitly state:
    - A customer's right to receive a refund.
    - How any presales funds are being used. (Only permitted after MOC approval)
    - How a customer will receive their refund.
    - Length of time it will take to receive.

### 5. Communicate Product Support Plan

Manufacturers must clearly communicate their complete product support plan **on their website**
including:

- Mobile application(s) required for Hotspot on-boarding
- How they plan to support their Onboarding server
- The expected lifetime of free OTA updates for products
  - Disclose any “premium” or fee-based features, including extending the product lifetime of OTA
    updates.

### 6. Keep Product Information Up To Data

Manufacturers must keep their Helium-compatible product information up to date on their website\*\*
including:

- Product information including:
  - Model name
  - Countries serviced
- User installation guides
- Links to Helium Network reference sites
  - [https://status.helium.com/](https://status.helium.com/)
  - [https://engineering.helium.com/](https://engineering.helium.com/)
  - [https://discord.com/invite/helium](https://discord.com/invite/helium)

### 7. Communicate and Perform Firmware and Network Updates

The Helium blockchain and Helium Network are rapidly evolving and require frequent firmware and
network updates.

- Manufacturers must proactively communicate **on their website** the status of their products
  relative to the Helium blockchain and network including:
  - OTA status
  - The current firmware revision number

### 8. Maintain Firmware

Firmware updates must be promptly maintained by manufacturers.

- We expect that manufacturers have an automated process by which their firmware is updated.

### 9. Communicate HNT Acquisition Plan for Onboarding

Manufacturers must clearly communicate **to the MCC on their HIP-19 proposal** how they intend to
obtain the HNT needed to fund onboarding. Approved Hotspot Makers are responsible for supplying Data
Credits (DCs) to the onboarding server for Hotspots they sell.

### 10. Maintain Integrity of the Helium Network

Manufacturers are responsible for the integrity of the network and should take care to sell only to
genuine resellers and partners. Manufacturers will be held accountable for the integrity of their
distributor/ reseller network.

### 11. The MCC considers Dual-Mining to be a gateway/Hotspot that mines both Helium tokens and another application.

1. Dual-mining is only permitted so long as it does not conflict with a DeWi Network.
   1. A DeWi network is any decentralized wireless network running on a blockchain and issuing
      tokens. Examples include LoRaWAN, CBRS, WiFi, etc.
2. Dual-Mining on a Hotspot, on another DeWi network in a way that is competitive with the growth of
   Helium Networks is not allowed.
