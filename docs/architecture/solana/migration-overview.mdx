Following the community-driven proposal outlined in [HIP70 - Scaling the Helium Network](https://github.com/helium/HIP/blob/main/0070-scaling-helium.md), the Helium Network underwent a successful migration to the Solana blockchain on **April 18, 2023, at 9am PST** (16:00 UTC). This strategic decision, endorsed by the community, empowered the Helium Network to leverage Solana's remarkable scalability, low transaction costs, and high-performance capabilities, including rapid transaction throughput and an energy-efficient consensus mechanism.

The transition to Solana ushered in numerous benefits for the Helium Network: it facilitated even greater scalability for the IoT and Mobile networks, enabled support for more sophisticated Proof-of-Coverage algorithms, and bolstered the network's resilience, rendering it an even more compelling solution for high-demand applications.
