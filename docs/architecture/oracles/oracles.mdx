The migration of Helium L1 to Solana L1 heralds significant alterations to the Network's setup and the underlying infrastructure of its associated subDAOs. Foremost among these changes is the relocation of substantial on-chain data, particularly Proof-of-Coverage (PoC) data, to an off-chain environment.

In effecting this migration, several Oracles have been implemented to serve as vital conduits between the blockchain and the external realm. These pivotal infrastructure adjustments not only pave the way for the seamless introduction of new Networks as Decentralized Network Protocol (DNP) subDAOs but also facilitate the streamlined scaling of existing DNP subDAOs, such as IOT, by eliminating prevalent bottlenecks.

With the deprecation of the Helium L1, changes to the API and
[ETL](https://github.com/helium/blockchain-etl) include:

1. Existing ETL codebase will no longer sync blocks.
2. Existing API codebase will no longer serve new data, the API codebase will remain accessible on
   GitHub at [https://github.com/helium/blockchain-http](https://github.com/helium/blockchain-http)
3. api.helium.io (built on top of legacy ETL and API) is no longer available.
4. The legacy Explorer hosted at explorer-old.helium.com is no longer available, the Explorer
   codebase will remain accessible on GitHub at
   [https://github.com/helium/explorer](https://github.com/helium/explorer).

<summary>Accessing Historical Blockchain Data</summary>

The Legacy Blockchain API was retired on July 28, 2023.

For details on alternate sources of the legacy Helium L1 data, please see the
[Blockchain API Solana Migration Guide](/solana/migration/blockchain-api).

**New API access options include:**

1. New datasets are available and will continue to be available on
   [AWS S3, via compressed Protobuf files](/oracles/oracle-data).
2. Sample API code has been published in the
   [Oracles S3 Observer Sample App](https://github.com/dewi-alliance/oracle-observer-sample). It
   uses AWS Lambda to ingest the S3 files to a PostgreSQL database and serve them as JSON via an
   API.
3. Third parties are working on new APIs and services to replace existing tools (e.g.,
   [Hotspotty](https://hotspotty.net/api/),
   [HeliumGeek](https://heliumgeek.com/b/helium-offchain-api.html),
   [Relay](https://www.relaydevice.com), etc.).
