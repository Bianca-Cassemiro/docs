# FAQ - Security

<LegacyContentBanner />

Ensuring the security of both our network and Hotspot owners remains our paramount concern. While an Internet connection is essential, it's solely utilized to furnish backhaul to the Hotspot for blockchain peer-to-peer and LoRaWAN networking purposes. Given the omnipresence of security threats, here's a comprehensive overview of our proactive measures to mitigate potential risks:

1. **Closed Inbound Ports**: Recognizing inbound ports as a common entry point for attacks, we've implemented a pivotal change. As of May 2022, Helium Hotspots no longer necessitate any open or forwarded inbound ports.

2. **Hardware-Level Security for LoRaWAN Devices**: Helium-enabled LoRaWAN devices boast hardware-level security measures to safeguard traffic within the utilized spectrum. Each device enjoys AES private key encryption at the chip level, ensuring built-in security.

3. **Regulatory Compliance**: All approved Helium Hotspots adhere rigorously to the pertinent radio and wireless regulations in their respective deployment regions. For instance, Hotspots in the US comply meticulously with FCC regulations governing operation within the unlicensed 902-928MHz spectrum, while those in Europe bear the CE mark for the 868MHz spectrum, and so forth.

4. **Minimal Bandwidth Utilization**: Devices connected to the Helium network typically utilize bandwidth ranging from 1-5kb/s, akin to the size of a lengthy text message. Notably, communication occurs over LoRaWAN, bypassing the need for IP (Internet Protocol) usage.

5. **Transaction Data Credits**: While leveraging the Helium network is notably cost-effective, it's important to note that transactions necessitate data credits. This inherent requirement serves as a deterrent against potential malicious actors.

6. **Secure Helium Wallets**: Helium wallets, seamlessly integrated within the Helium App, employ asymmetric keys to safeguard your private key, ensuring robust security measures.

7. **Continuous Security Enhancements**: We remain steadfast in our commitment to diligent oversight and continuous improvement across all facets of network security. This unwavering dedication is aimed at safeguarding you—the invaluable members of The People's Network—as we collectively chart a transformative journey into the IoT era.

These proactive steps underscore our unwavering dedication to fostering a secure environment within the Helium ecosystem, empowering individuals like you to play a pivotal role in shaping the future of IoT.
