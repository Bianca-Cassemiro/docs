## Founding and Early Vision


The **Helium Network**, established in 2013 by visionaries Amir Haleem, Shawn Fanning, and Sean Carey, emerged from a shared ambition to pioneer a decentralized wireless infrastructure tailored to meet the burgeoning demands of the IoT industry. Their vision was to democratize **IoT connectivity**, rendering it accessible to all, by forging a network powered by individuals and propelled by economic incentives, thereby dismantling traditional barriers to entry.


## Launch of the Helium Hotspot

In 2019, **Helium** unveiled its groundbreaking innovation, the Helium Hotspot, marking a pivotal moment in wireless connectivity. This cutting-edge device empowered users to extend wireless coverage for IoT devices through an innovative protocol known as **LongFi**. LongFi ingeniously amalgamated the extensive reach of LoRaWAN with the robust security of the Helium blockchain. Enthusiastic early adopters swiftly embraced this technology, deploying Hotspots to not only contribute to network coverage but also to earn coveted HNT tokens as a testament to their invaluable participation.


## Expansion and Adoption

As Hotspots proliferated worldwide, the Helium Network surged in prominence, captivating the attention of developers, corporations, and individual enthusiasts alike. With each deployment, the network's reach extended, spanning across diverse nations and unlocking a myriad of innovative use cases. This relentless expansion not only bolstered its status as a premier decentralized wireless infrastructure provider but also underscored its pivotal role in shaping the future of connectivity.

## Transition to Solana Blockchain

In pursuit of enhanced scalability, security, and decentralization, the Helium Network made a strategic transition to the Solana blockchain. This pivotal move empowered Helium to harness the unparalleled performance  capabilities of Solana, imperative for accommodating the burgeoning influx of network participants and  transactions. This migration not only fortified the network's infrastructure but also positioned Helium at the forefront of innovation in the realm of wireless connectivity.

## Introduction of Subnetworks and New Tokens

As the Helium Network evolved, it broadened its scope by introducing specialized subnetworks tailored to distinct wireless technologies like **LoRaWAN** and **5G**. These subnetworks introduced their native tokens, IOT and MOBILE, respectively, while adopting the innovative Proof-of-Coverage consensus algorithm. This algorithm served as a cornerstone, incentivizing participants with network coverage rewards and further enhancing the network's resilience and efficacy.

## Present and Future

Presently, the **Helium Network** stands as a burgeoning force in the realm of decentralized wireless infrastructure, spanning the globe with its expansive reach. Its allure persists, drawing in a steady stream of new users, developers, and organizations, all contributing to its dynamic ecosystem. Spearheading a wave of innovation, the network serves as a fertile ground for the inception of pioneering applications and services. With each stride in expansion, its overarching mission remains steadfast: to redefine the landscape of wireless communication, making connectivity more accessible and equitable for all.
