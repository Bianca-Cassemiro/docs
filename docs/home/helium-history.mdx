## Founding and Early Vision


The **Helium Network**, established in 2013 by visionaries Amir Haleem, Shawn Fanning, and Sean Carey, emerged from <br/>a shared ambition to pioneer a decentralized wireless infrastructure tailored to meet the burgeoning demands of <br/>the IoT industry. Their vision was to democratize **IoT connectivity**, rendering it accessible to all, by forging <br/>a network powered by individuals and propelled by economic incentives, thereby dismantling traditional barriers to entry.


## Launch of the Helium Hotspot

In 2019, **Helium** unveiled its groundbreaking innovation, the Helium Hotspot, marking a pivotal moment in wireless <br/>connectivity. This cutting-edge device empowered users to extend wireless coverage for IoT devices through an <br/>innovative protocol known as **LongFi**. LongFi ingeniously amalgamated the extensive reach of LoRaWAN with the robust <br/>security of the Helium blockchain. Enthusiastic early adopters swiftly embraced this technology, deploying <br/>Hotspots to not only contribute to network coverage but also to earn coveted HNT tokens as a testament to their <br/>invaluable participation.


## Expansion and Adoption

As Hotspots proliferated worldwide, the Helium Network surged in prominence, captivating the attention of <br/>developers, corporations, and individual enthusiasts alike. With each deployment, the network's reach extended, <br/>spanning across diverse nations and unlocking a myriad of innovative use cases. This relentless expansion not only <br/>bolstered its status as a premier decentralized wireless infrastructure provider but also underscored its <br/>pivotal role in shaping the future of connectivity.

## Transition to Solana Blockchain

In pursuit of enhanced scalability, security, and decentralization, the Helium Network made a strategic transition  <br/>to the Solana blockchain. This pivotal move empowered Helium to harness the unparalleled performance  <br/>capabilities of Solana, imperative for accommodating the burgeoning influx of network participants and  <br/>transactions. This migration not only fortified the network's infrastructure but also positioned Helium at the  <br/>forefront of innovation in the realm of wireless connectivity.

## Introduction of Subnetworks and New Tokens

As the Helium Network evolved, it broadened its scope by introducing specialized subnetworks tailored to distinct <br/>wireless technologies like **LoRaWAN** and **5G**. These subnetworks introduced their native tokens, IOT and MOBILE, <br/>respectively, while adopting the innovative Proof-of-Coverage consensus algorithm. This algorithm served as a <br/>cornerstone, incentivizing participants with network coverage rewards and further enhancing the network's <br/>resilience and efficacy.

## Present and Future

Presently, the **Helium Network** stands as a burgeoning force in the realm of decentralized wireless infrastructure,<br/> spanning the globe with its expansive reach. Its allure persists, drawing in a steady stream of new users, developers, <br/>and organizations, all contributing to its dynamic ecosystem. Spearheading a wave of innovation, the network serves <br/>as a fertile ground for the inception of pioneering applications and services. With each stride in expansion, its <br/>overarching mission remains steadfast: to redefine the landscape of wireless communication, making connectivity <br/>more accessible and equitable for all.
