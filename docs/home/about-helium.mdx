# Overview of the Helium Network

<LegacyContentBanner />


## Introduction

The **Helium Network** represents an innovative approach to wireless infrastructure, operating in a decentralized  manner and utilizing blockchain technology. This project enables both individuals and organizations to establish and manage wireless networks by offering token incentives. Built upon the robust foundation of the Solana Blockchain, the network's backbone is powered by the **HNT token**. Additionally, specialized tokens such as IOT and MOBILE play integral roles in supporting the LoRaWAN and 5G networks, respectively. Notably, the subnetworks operate on a distinctive consensus algorithm known as Proof-of-Coverage (PoC), enhancing the network's reliability and security.

## Helium Network Components

**Solana Blockchain:** Serving as the foundational backbone, the Solana Blockchain ensures the Helium Network's security, scalability, and decentralization, underpinning its entire infrastructure.

**HNT Token:**As the native token of the Helium Network, HNT drives participant incentives and transaction facilitation, playing a crucial role in sustaining the network's operations.

**IOT Token:** Tailored for the LoRaWAN network, the IOT token facilitates connectivity for Internet of Things (IoT) devices, leveraging a Proof-of-Coverage (PoC) consensus mechanism to ensure network reliability and efficiency.

**MOBILE Token:** Designed for the 5G network, the MOBILE token enables seamless high-speed mobile connectivity and data transmission, employing a PoC consensus mechanism to maintain the integrity and performance of the 5G subnetwork.

## Network Participants

**Hotspot Owners:** These are individuals or organizations responsible for deploying and upkeeping Helium-compatible    wireless devices, known as Hotspots, to extend network coverage and support the Helium ecosystem.

**IoT Device Owners:** These are users of Internet of Things (IoT) devices who utilize the Helium Network for connectivity, benefiting from its efficiency and reliability in facilitating communication between devices.

**Mobile Device Users:** This refers to individuals who access the 5G network through the infrastructure provided  by the Helium Network, experiencing high-speed connectivity and seamless data transmission on their mobile devices.

**Developers:** Individuals or organizations engaged in creating applications and services that harness the capabilities of the Helium Network infrastructure, contributing to its growth and innovation through their innovative solutions.

## Key Features
