# Overview of the Helium Network

<LegacyContentBanner />


## Introduction

The **Helium Network** represents an innovative approach to wireless infrastructure, operating in a decentralized <br/> manner and utilizing blockchain technology. This project enables both individuals and organizations to establish <br/> and manage wireless networks by offering token incentives. Built upon the robust foundation of the Solana Blockchain,<br/> the network's backbone is powered by the **HNT token**. Additionally, specialized tokens such as IOT and MOBILE play <br/>integral roles in supporting the LoRaWAN and 5G networks, respectively. Notably, the subnetworks operate on a distinctive consensus algorithm known as Proof-of-Coverage (PoC), enhancing the network's reliability and security.

## Helium Network Components

**Solana Blockchain:** Serving as the foundational backbone, the Solana Blockchain ensures the Helium Network's <br/>security, scalability, and decentralization, underpinning its entire infrastructure.

**HNT Token:**As the native token of the Helium Network, HNT drives participant incentives and transaction <br/>facilitation, playing a crucial role in sustaining the network's operations.

**IOT Token:** Tailored for the LoRaWAN network, the IOT token facilitates connectivity for Internet of Things (IoT) <br/>devices, leveraging a Proof-of-Coverage (PoC) consensus mechanism to ensure network reliability and efficiency.

**MOBILE Token:** Designed for the 5G network, the MOBILE token enables seamless high-speed mobile connectivity and <br/>data transmission, employing a PoC consensus mechanism to maintain the integrity and performance of the 5G <br/>subnetwork.

## Network Participants

**Hotspot Owners:** These are individuals or organizations responsible for deploying and upkeeping Helium-compatible  <br/>  wireless devices, known as Hotspots, to extend network coverage and support the Helium ecosystem.

**IoT Device Owners:** These are users of Internet of Things (IoT) devices who utilize the Helium Network for <br/>connectivity, benefiting from its efficiency and reliability in facilitating communication between devices.

**Mobile Device Users:** This refers to individuals who access the 5G network through the infrastructure provided <br/> by the Helium Network, experiencing high-speed connectivity and seamless data transmission on their mobile devices.

**Developers:** Individuals or organizations engaged in creating applications and services that harness the <br/>capabilities of the Helium Network infrastructure, contributing to its growth and innovation through their <br/>innovative solutions.

## Key Features

**Decentralized Infrastructure:** The Helium Network facilitates the establishment and upkeep of a decentralized <br/>wireless network by motivating contributors to share resources and reap the rewards.

**Scalable and Secure:** By harnessing the Solana Blockchain, renowned for its remarkable scalability, minimal <br/>latency, and robust security measures, the Helium Network ensures reliability and efficiency.

**Multi-Use Case Support:** The Helium Network caters to diverse applications, accommodating IoT devices via the <br/>LoRaWAN network and delivering high-speed mobile connectivity through the 5G network.

**Incentivized Participation:** Through a token-based system, the Helium Network incentivizes active involvement, <br/>fostering network expansion and sustainability.

**Proof-of-Coverage (PoC):** A distinctive consensus algorithm utilized by the LoRaWAN and 5G subnetworks, PoC <br/>rewards participants for validating wireless network coverage, ensuring integrity and reliability.
